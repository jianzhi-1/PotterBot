What a crowd. And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren¡¯t too many people outside protesting, OK. That I can tell you. A lot of people in here, a lot of people pouring right now. They can get them in. Whatever you can do, fire marshals, we¡¯ll appreciate it. And I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, for the introduction.
As well as my friend Dr. Ben Carson. And thank you to a very, very special man, Franklin Graham, Reverend Franklin Graham, for leading us in prayer. And thank you too Alveda King, the niece of the great Dr. Martin Luther King. It really shows you that America is indeed a nation of faith, we know that.
Well, I¡¯m thrilled to be back in Phoenix, in the great state of Arizona. With so many thousands of hard-working American patriots. You know I¡¯d love it if the cameras could show this crowd, because it is rather incredible. It is incredible. It is incredible. As everybody here remembers, this was the scene of my first rally speech, right? The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight, that the people said right at the beginning, you know, there¡¯s something special happening here. And we went to center stage almost from day one in the debates. We love those debates.
But we went to center stage and we never left, right? All of us, we did it together. You were there at the start. You¡¯ve been there every single day since, and I will never forget. Believe me, Arizona, I will never forget. And I¡¯m here tonight to send a message: We are fully and totally committed to fighting for our agenda, and we will not stop until the job is done. 
This evening, joined together with friends, we reaffirm our shared customs, traditions and values. We love our country. We celebrate our troops. We embrace our freedom. We respect our flag. We are proud of our history. We cherish our Constitution, including, by the way, the Second Amendment.
We fully protect religious liberty. We believe in law and order. And we support the incredible men and of law enforcement.
And we pledge our allegiance to one nation under God.
You always understood what Washington, D.C. did not. Our movement is a movement built on love. It¡¯s love for fellow citizens. It¡¯s love for struggling Americans who¡¯ve been left behind, and love for every American child who deserves a chance to have all of their dreams come true.
From the inner cities to the rural outposts, from the Sun Belt to the Rust Belt, from east to west and north to south, our movement is built on the conviction that every American from every background is entitled to a government that puts their needs first.
It is finally time to rebuild our country, to take care of our people, and to fight for the jobs our great American workers deserve, and that¡¯s what we¡¯re doing.
After our amazing election victory, the forgotten men and women ¡ª remember we used to talk about the forgotten men and women before the election? Guess what? They¡¯re not forgotten¡­
anymore, right? Anymore. No, they¡¯re not forgotten anymore folks. In fact, they¡¯re trying to figure you out. They¡¯re saying the obstructionists, how do we get them to vote for us? I don¡¯t think that¡¯s going to happen any time soon.
We believe that every American has the right to live with dignity. Respect for America demands respect for all of its people. Loyalty to our nation requires loyalty to each other, We all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future. A wound inflicted upon one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all. You saw last night. You saw last night.
Did anybody watch last night? Yes.
When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. And when one American suffers an injustice, all of America suffers together. We¡¯re all together.
It¡¯s time for us to follow the example of our brave American soldiers. And I was with a lot of them last night, Fort Myers.
No matter where they come from, no matter what faith they practice, they form a single unbreakable team. That¡¯s what we are. We¡¯re a team. As a nation, we¡¯re a team.
They¡¯re all united by their devotion to our country and to their mission. It¡¯s time for all of us to remember that we are all on the same team. We are all Americans, and we all believe right now in America first.
And it¡¯s happening, and it¡¯s happening fast. I see all those red hats and white hats. It¡¯s all happening very fast. It¡¯s called ¡°Make America Great Again.¡± You see what¡¯s going on.
It¡¯s coming back, very fast.
We want every child to succeed, every community to prosper and every struggling American to have a chance for a better life. What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America.
And tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and violence.
